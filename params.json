{"name":"NovelIO","tagline":"F# Functional IO Library","body":"### Introduction\r\nNovelIO is a library designed to bring the explicit safety and robustness of Haskell's IO monad to the .NET framework.  The result is a purely functional approach to describing I/O operations whereby the evaluation of functions do not produce side-effects, rather they describe sequenced operations which can later be evaluated.\r\n\r\nMuch like in Haskell, we introduce the `IO<'a>` type which represents some action that, when performed successfully, results in some type `'a`.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nNovelIO was conceived and created by @TheInnerLight\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
